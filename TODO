MAJOR:
* There is a problem with objects IDs with spaces(e.g. 'test char'), such IDs should be
  ignored as invalid or placed inside quotation for output
* Troff documentation for chaptershow, engineshow, objectadd, objecthave, objectremove,
  objectuse
* Tests for: chaptershow, engineexport, engineshow, moduleadd, moduleremove, moduleshow,
  objectadd, objecthave, objectremove, objectset, objectshow, objectuse, resshow
* Every command without options(-o) is crashing the program
* Ash: passing arguments to scripts(to execute some script with arguments)
MINOR:
* Additional Unix-like syntax for commands
* Some invalid commands(no object/target args) crashing program
* Attributes option for objectshow
* areadd, arearemove commands
